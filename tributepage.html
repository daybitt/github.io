            <h2>Leadership of the Kuomintang</h2>

                <img src="img/Chiang_Kai-shek_Leader.jpg" alt="Young Chiang Kai-shek" id="image-leader">
                <div id="two-columns">
                    <ul><strong>Leadership Policies</strong>
                        <li>National Unification: Chiang's primary goal was to unify China under the Kuomintang (KMT) rule. He believed a strong central government was necessary for modernization and national security.</li>
                        <li>One-Party Rule: Chiang aimed to establish the KMT as the sole legitimate party, suppressing dissent and opposing ideologies like communism.</li>
                        <li>Economic Reforms: He attempted to modernize China's economy through infrastructure projects and land reform efforts (though the success of these reforms is debated).</li>
                        <li>Military Focus: Chiang prioritized military strength, believing a strong army was crucial for national defense and defeating the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</li>
                        <li>Social Reforms: While limited, Chiang's government implemented some social reforms like promoting women's rights and education. However, these efforts were often overshadowed by his authoritarian tendencies.</li>
                        <strong>Chinese Civil War (1927-1949)</strong>
                        <li>Early Success: Following Sun Yat-sen's death, Chiang led the KMT's Northern Expedition (1926-1928), a military campaign that nominally unified much of China under KMT control.</li>
                        <li>KMT-CCP Split: A power struggle erupted between the KMT and the CCP within the united front against the warlords. In 1927, Chiang launched a brutal purge of communists, marking the official start of the Civil War.</li>
                        <li>Long and Brutal Conflict: The Civil War was a protracted and bloody struggle. The KMT initially had more resources, but the CCP, led by Mao Zedong, gained popular support, particularly among the peasantry.</li>
                        <li>Japanese Invasion (1937): The war was temporarily halted by the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) where both the KMT and CCP fought against Japan. However, the conflict continued after Japan's defeat.</li>
                        <li>KMT Retreat to Taiwan (1949): The CCP gained momentum after WWII due to various factors, including KMT corruption and failing land reforms. By 1949, the CCP achieved a decisive victory, forcing Chiang and the remnants of the KMT government to flee to Taiwan.</li>

                        <strong>Relocation to Taiwan</strong>
                        <li>Establishing a Government in Exile: Chiang Kai-shek relocated his government and about two million KMT supporters to the island of Taiwan. He maintained the claim that the KMT was the legitimate government of all China.</li>
                        <li>Martial Law: Chiang imposed martial law in Taiwan, suppressing dissent and consolidating his power. This period, known as the "White Terror," saw human rights abuses and political repression.</li>
                        <li>Economic Development: Despite the authoritarian rule, Taiwan's economy underwent significant growth under Chiang's leadership. Land reforms were implemented more effectively here, and U.S. aid further fueled economic development.</li>
                        <li>Legacy of the "Two Chinas": Chiang's relocation to Taiwan created a complex situation where mainland China, under the CCP, and Taiwan, governed by the KMT, existed as separate entities. This continues to be a major point of tension in the region.</li>

            <h2>Controversies & Legacy</h2>
            <img src="img/ZongTongWanSui.jpg" alt="Propaganda Stamp" id="image-controversy">
            <p> Chiang Kai-shek remains a deeply controversial figure in Chinese history.</p>
            <p>His policies of authoritarianism and the suppression of dissent led to human rights abuses, including the imprisonment and execution of political opponents.</p>
            <p>Critics highlight his disastrous military decisions during the Chinese Civil War, which  contributed to the CCP victory.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the period of martial law in Taiwan under his rule is associated with significant political repression.</p>
            <p>Despite implementing some social reforms and guiding Taiwan's economic development in its early phases, Chiang's legacy is marred by the limitations on basic freedoms under his reign.</p>
